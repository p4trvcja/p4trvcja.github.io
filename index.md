# Welcome to my website
I'm a first-year Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student at AGH UST.
This website is part of the project for a subject **IT Tools**.


## Something about me
My name is Patrycja and I'm eighteen years old. In my free time (or rather *if i have time besides studying*) i enjoy hiking, meeting with my friends and 
reading books, especially literary fiction and fantasy.


## What about the project?
My wonderful team and I decided to create a quiz game based on a popular show **_Million dollar money drop_**, where the aim is to answer correctly to 10 questions and win **as many money as possible**. The trick is that each answer option corresponds to a different trapdoor and only one answer is correct. The contestants have a fixed amount of time to distribute all the money among the drops as they see fit; however, they were required to leave at least one drop "clear", meaning that **no money may be allocated on at least one answer**.

Our version of the game will contain additional aspects which will diversify the contest.
