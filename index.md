# Welcome to my website
I'm a first-year Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student at AGH UST in Cracow.
This website is part of the project for a subject **IT Tools**.

## What about the project?
My team "Milionerzy" (ang. millionaires) and I decided to create a quiz game based on a popular show **"Million dollar money drop"**, where the aim is to answer correctly to 10 questions and win as many money as possible. The trick is that each answer option corresponds to a different trapdoor and only one answer is correct. The contestants have a fixed amount of time to distribute all the money among the drops as they see fit; however, they were required to leave at least one drop "clear", meaning that no money may be allocated on at least one answer.
[More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Money_Drop)

Our version of the game will contain additional aspects which will diversify the contest.

| what is originally in the game| what will be added | done? |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| no life preservers | 50/50, a phone to a friend | not yet |
| boring sound effects | gripping sound effects | not yet |
| real money that you can win | no real money but satisfaction | not yet |


## In the future...
What will the future bring? No one knows. But my plans are to pass this semester and learn how to code.

Stay tuned! Maybe our game will enter the market and sooner or later we'll become millionaires.
