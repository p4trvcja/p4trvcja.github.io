## Welcome to my website
I'm a first-year Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student at AGH UST.
This website is part of the project for a subject IT Tools.

## Something about me
My name is Patrycja and I'm eighteen years old. In my free time (or rather **if i have time besides studying**) i enjoy hiking, meeting with my friends and 
reading books, especially literary fiction and fantasy.

## What about the project?
My wonderful team and I decided to create a game based on a popular quiz show *Million dollar money drop*, where the aim is to answer correctly 
to 10 questions and win as many money as possible.

Our version of the game will contain additional aspects which will diversify the contest.
